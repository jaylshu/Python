# IV - Final Project - I decided to analyze congressional district data, particularly after the recent redistricting cycle. Specifically, I wanted to see how urbanization impacted a districtâ€™s partisan lean. One often hears the generalization that cities are blue and rural areas are red, but I wanted to confirm that, and see whether it applies nationally or there are differences by state and/or region. I used this dataset (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/district-urbanization-index-2022) and also fit a simple regression model towards the end.
